# Valorant-Triggerbot
This repository includes a Valorant triggerbot designed to automatically shoot enemies in the game. Please be aware that using a triggerbot in Valorant violates the game's terms of service and may lead to a ban.

# How It Works:
The Triggerbot uses computer vision to detect enemies on the screen and automatically shoots when an enemy is in the crosshair. The bot shoots upon detecting a specified color (default is yellow, user-configurable).

# How to Install / Start
1. Download the latest version of VTB (Valorant TriggerBot) onto your computer. If you haven't installed Java, refer to the guide on 'How to Install Java' below.
2. Open the command prompt (cmd) and type 'java -jar path/to/the/VTB.jar' to start.

# How to Install Java
1. Download Java (https://download.oracle.com/java/22/latest/jdk-22_windows-x64_bin.exe).
2. Run the downloaded installer.
3. Follow the installation instructions.
4. After installation, you can check if Java is correctly installed by opening cmd and typing 'java -version'. If no errors appear, Java should be set up correctly.
