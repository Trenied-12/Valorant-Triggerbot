# Valorant-Triggerbot
The VTB is a Valorant triggerbot designed to automatically instantly shoot the enemies in the game.

# How It Works:
The Triggerbot detects enemies on the screen and automatically shoots when an enemy is in the crosshair. The bot shoots upon detecting a specified color (default is yellow, user-configurable).

# How to Install / Start
1. Download the latest version of VTB (Valorant TriggerBot) onto your computer.
2. Open the command prompt (cmd) and type 'java -jar path/to/the/VTB.jar' to start. If you haven't installed Java, refer to the guide on 'How to Install Java' below.
3. Make sure, you have "Raw Input Buffer" in the settings of Valorant disabled!

# How to Install Java
1. Download the Java installer (https://download.oracle.com/java/22/latest/jdk-22_windows-x64_bin.exe).
2. Run the downloaded installer.
3. Follow the installation instructions.
4. After installation, you can check if Java is correctly installed by opening cmd and typing 'java -version'. If no errors appear, Java should be set up correctly.
